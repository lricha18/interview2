# SOSI SPD Techincal Review Questions

This repo contains a selection of problems that embody some of the programming concepts we use here at SPD.

*Please fork this repository into your own Github, we will use the fork for reference during the interview.*

There are 4 problems in total:

- Two Python 3 problems (data structures, string parsing, optimization)
- A Golang (1.10) problem (pointers, concurrency)
- A VueJS problem (Javascript, Node, Vue Framework, single page applications)

Every problem is challenging in its own way. We don't expect you to complete or attempt every problem (although you definitely can).

During the interview, we will discuss the problems that have been attempted, and any challenges faced during implementation.
